# Frontend
Frontend The frontend of this project provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the HR data analysis system. It is built using React and communicates with the backend to display processed HR insights. It uses technologies like Django REST API for data exchange, HTML5 and CSS3 for layout and styling, Axios for HTTP requests, React Router for navigation, and Chart.js or Recharts for visualizing HR analytics.

The frontend allows users to view dashboards with key HR metrics such as employee turnover, headcount, and payroll trends. It includes interactive charts to visualize historical HR data, and a detailed employee data view with search and filter functionality. The interface is fully responsive, working seamlessly on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices, and it fetches historical HR data from the backend to present insights interactively. 

To set up, users need to clone the repository, install dependencies, and start the development server. The frontend will automatically reload on code changes. For production deployment, the app can be built to generate an optimized version for distribution.
